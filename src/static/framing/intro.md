Throughout the Slack platform, you'll encounter collections of things. Lists of users. Arrays of channels. A pride of lion emoji.

When you call an API method to retrieve most of these collections, they're returned to you in portions. Our goal is to familiarize you with the main pagination patterns you can use with our API methods, and give you the tools and inspiration you need to summon your desired datasets!  

Most methods that support pagination use a cursor-based approach, although we currently support a few “classic” approaches to pagination in our legacy methods. The individual documentation for each API method is your source of truth for which pattern the method follows.
